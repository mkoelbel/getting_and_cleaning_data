Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data" final project


To run this script, clone this remote repository to make a local repo. If necessary, install the 'dplyr' R package. Then open the run_analysis.R script and run all of the code in it.

This run_analysis.R script pulls in data .txt files from the 'UCI HAR Dataset' directory, transforms those datasets into a tidy dataset, creates a tidy summary dataset of averages, and then outputs a CSV of the summary dataset.
